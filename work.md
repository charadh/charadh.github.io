#### [2025 Hansberry-Lilly Fellowship Winner](https://playbill.com/article/charlene-adhiambo-and-amy-b-tiong-receive-2025-hansberry-lilly-fellowship)
The Dramatists Guild Foundation (DGF), in partnership with The Lillys, have announced graduate students Charlene Adhiambo and Amy B. Tiong as the 2025 recipients for the Hansberry-Lilly Fellowship. Created in honor of playwright Lorraine Hansberry (A Raisin in the Sun, The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window), the fellowships ensure that the next generation of women and non-binary playwrights of color are able to follow in Hansberry's footsteps, allowing them to create new work and develop their writing careers regardless of their economic situation. Each recipient receives a $25,000 stipend for each year of matriculation at select writing programs across the country, with up to $75,000 available to subsidize living expenses not covered by tuition. Past recipients of the Hansberry-Lilly Fellowship are Darrin Terpstra and Morgan Webber-Ottey (2024), and Amalia Oliva Rojas and Danielle Stagger (2023).

"Devastating, thought-provoking, and delightful. It’s a landmark in short horror fiction." ***— Publishers Weekly, ★ STARRED REVIEW***

"A gruesome and decidedly queer patchwork revealing some of the most devastating and unsettling horrors I've ever encountered. Each page of Bury Your Gays: An Anthology of Tragic Queer Horror pulses with a distinct sense of inevitability, a horrifying sureness guiding the reader on a pathway toward destruction, toward utter despair. These pernicious little tales will haunt you long after you've been entombed in the enchantment of their grotesquery." ***— Eric LaRocca, author of Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke***

"Bury Your Gays draws pain into a bath, perfumes the water with lavender and bergamot, invites you to strip. Sink in. Stay a while. Drown." ***— Rae Knowles, author of Merciless Waters***

"Bury Your Gays sinks into a darkness that writhes with lust and dreams and death. An entrancing spiral into the countless nightmares of life as a queer person." ***— Eric Raglin, author of Extinction Hymns***
