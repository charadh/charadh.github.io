PRAISE FOR BURY YOUR GAYS

"Devastating, thought-provoking, and delightful. It’s a landmark in short horror fiction." ***— Publishers Weekly, ★ STARRED REVIEW***

"A gruesome and decidedly queer patchwork revealing some of the most devastating and unsettling horrors I've ever encountered. Each page of Bury Your Gays: An Anthology of Tragic Queer Horror pulses with a distinct sense of inevitability, a horrifying sureness guiding the reader on a pathway toward destruction, toward utter despair. These pernicious little tales will haunt you long after you've been entombed in the enchantment of their grotesquery." ***— Eric LaRocca, author of Things Have Gotten Worse Since We Last Spoke***

"Bury Your Gays draws pain into a bath, perfumes the water with lavender and bergamot, invites you to strip. Sink in. Stay a while. Drown." ***— Rae Knowles, author of Merciless Waters***

"Bury Your Gays sinks into a darkness that writhes with lust and dreams and death. An entrancing spiral into the countless nightmares of life as a queer person." ***— Eric Raglin, author of Extinction Hymns***
