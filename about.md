  Welcome! I’m Charlene Alaro Adhiambo (she/her)
</p>

 Charlene Adhiambo is a Kenyan-American, Harlem based, Atlanta-raised multidisciplinary artist and playwright. Her craft was nurtured while attending Columbia University where she received a B.A. in Creative Writing and English. While attending Columbia, Adhiambo developed a knack for musical curation which has greatly influenced her later written work. Charlene’s work delves deep into the intersectional planes of identity, family, childhood, blackness, space and expansion. Through each of Adhiambo’s pieces we get glimpses of black womanhood and the cage that one may be bound to because of the societal implications. Her current work (BI)CYCLES digs deep into the layers of romantic, self, and familial love. Adhiambo’s one-act play GUARDIAN (stage read at Saudade Theatre’s Re-Descobrimentos Festival, 2020) is a time-travel piece about a young girl in colonial Kenya who meets a girl from the 21st-century. Adhiambo has bylines in Catapult and the Columbia Spectator.
