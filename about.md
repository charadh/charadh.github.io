  Welcome! I’m Charlene Alaro Adhiambo (she/her)
</p>

 Charlene Adhiambo is a Kenyan-American, Harlem based, Atlanta-raised multidisciplinary artist and playwright. Her craft was nurtured while attending Columbia University where she received a B.A. in Creative Writing and English. Through each of Adhiambo’s pieces we get glimpses of black womanhood and the cage that one may be bound to because of the societal implications. Her short story "Lost and Found" was featured in Bury Your Gays: An Anthology of Tragic Queer Horror (2024, Ghoulish Books). Her current work (BI)CYCLES digs deep into the layers of romantic, self, and familial love. Adhiambo’s one-act play GUARDIAN (stage read at Saudade Theatre’s Re-Descobrimentos Festival, 2020) is a time-travel piece about a young girl in colonial Kenya who meets a girl from the 21st-century. Adhiambo has bylines in Catapult and the Columbia Spectator.
