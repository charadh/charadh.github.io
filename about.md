  Welcome! I’m Charlene Alaro Adhiambo (she/her)
</p>

   Charlene Adhiambo is a Kenyan American writer currently based in Harlem, NY. By day she does public health communications, and by night, has several creative pursuits: Her one act play Guardian was read at Saudade Theatre’s Re-Descobrimentos Festival in July 2020. She writes stage plays, screenplays fiction, and songs. While the containers and even genres of her work change, constant themes are mother- and daughterhood, black girl- and womanhood, friendship, romance, and grief. She writes in a space somewhere between Ray Bradbury and Toni Morrison, two of her favorite authors. 

   On her blog, she muses periodically on pop culture, particularly music, TV, and film. When not writing, she is listening to R&B music, teaching herself guitar, or doing yoga. She received her B.A. in Creative Writing and English Literature from Columbia University.
