  Welcome! Iâ€™m Charlene Alaro Adhiambo (she/her)
</p>

   <h4> I'm a writer-director, but to be a little fancy with it, I'm a storyteller. I express myself through film, theatre, music, fiction, and more. I recently graduated with a B.A. in Creative Writing from Columbia University. Currently I host a weekly writing workshop on Instagram called [Write Wrong](https://instagram.com/charlenealaro/) and am an Artistic Assistant at The Play Company. On my blog, I muse on pop culture, particularly music, TV, and film. I'm always down to collaborate and chat, so reach me at ca2716@columbia.edu.</h4>
