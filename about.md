  Hi! Iâ€™m Charlene Alaro Adhiambo (she/her)
</p>

   <h4> I describe myself in many ways (which include but are not limited to): playwright, filmmaker, screenwriter, novelist, and musician. In essence, I'm a storyteller. I recently graduated with a B.A. in Creative Writing from Columbia University. I'm always down to collaborate and chat, so reach me at ca2716@columbia.edu.</h4>
