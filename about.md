  Welcome! I’m Charlene Alaro Adhiambo (she/her)
</p>

   Charlene Adhiambo is a Kenyan American writer. She is the Artistic Assistant at Obie Award-winning theatre PlayCo. Her one act play Guardian was read at Saudade Theatre’s Re-Descobrimentos Festival in July 2020. Her creative work spans many mediums including (but not limited to), screenplay, stage play, fiction, essay, poetry, and song. While the containers and even genres of her work change, constant themes are mother- and daughterhood, black girl- and womanhood, friendship, romance, and grief. She writes in a space somewhere between Ray Bradbury and Toni Morrison, two of her favorite authors. 
   
   She is working on a chapbook, a novel, and a TV pilot while in her hometown of Atlanta, Georgia. She hosts a monthly writing workshop on Instagram called [Write Wrong](http://instagram.com/charlenealaro/)), which is currently on hiatus. On her blog, she muses on pop culture, particularly music, TV, and film. When not writing, she is listening to R&B music, teaching herself guitar, or doing yoga. She received her B.A. in Creative Writing and English Literature from Columbia University.
