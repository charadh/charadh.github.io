  Hi! Iâ€™m Charlene and this is my website.
</p>

  I recently graduated from Columbia University, and I'm now tackling things in my life in my blog here, and you can see some of my recent literary achievements in my portfolio. Feel free to get in touch with me if you're interested in working together.
