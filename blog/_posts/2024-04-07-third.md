The anthology BURY YOUR GAYS published on 3/19. I'm thrilled. This is a long time coming. I remember being 11 and wanting to be published. I finally am!

My story, LOST AND FOUND, is about Gabbie, a runaway, who finds a kindred spirit in Penelope, a magical undead woman who lives in her childhood home. This story, funnily enough, came to me in a dream. I had the image of Penelope, whose body is mummified in a tub, but who can communicate and envision everything through her mind. I wanted to know who she was or had been, and why she was there. LOST AND FOUND was born.

BURY YOUR GAYS is now available wherever books are sold.
