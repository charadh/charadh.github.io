Celeste is a lightweight Jekyll theme that features a minimalist, content-first design. It places your content center stage and lets your readers view them in a clutter-free environment without visual distractions. It is based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll butler, by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

### Built on Poole

Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). Poole, and all its derivatives (like Celeste) includes the following:

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, [404]({{ site.baseurl }}/404.html), [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/atom.xml), posts, and a [sample page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/))
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy of [rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge)

### Celeste Features

In addition to the features of Poole, Celeste adds the following:

* A design and structure with customizability in mind
* A clean, unobstrusive top navigation bar
* A landing page template for showcasing the most important content on your website
* Optimized for compatibility with most reading tools such as [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/).
* Subtle animations on UI elements that give visual feedback when interacting with the page
* Over 500 scalable vector icons, courtesy of [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/)

<!-- Additional features to follow -->
<!-- * A blog archives page, to allow easy access to old blog entries -->
<!-- * Multiple color schemes, accessible via the `@import` directive -->
